        Thank you for taking the time to review my take-home assignment. This
        mini-site is designed to showcase the different tasks Iâ€™ve completed as
        part of the challenge.

        Use the navigation above to explore each task individually. Each route
        represents a specific requirement.

        Thanks again for your time and consideration! <br />
