# 👋 Welcome – Cobalt Fairy Trial by Lazaros Ziskos

Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
This is a React project built to demonstrate clean architecture, component design, authenticated API handling, and a thoughtful user experience.

## ✅ Project Status

All required tasks have been successfully completed — including all core functionality, authentication flow, form handling, and protected API reque

Bonus improvements like styling, input validation, and navigation were added to enhance the experience and code clarity.

```

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```
/src
  /components     → Reusable UI elements
  /routes         → One page per task
  /context        → AuthContext for managing JWT login state
  /services       → Axios request helpers
  /validation     → Zod schema for form validation
```

## ✨ Extras & Enhancements
These features were added to go beyond the base requirements:

- Minimal SASS styling for a cleaner UI and better layout
- React Router to separate tasks into distinct routes
- Zod-based form validation (clean, type-safe)
- Clear code comments for reviewer readability
- A navigation bar to easily explore each task

## 🤝 Final Notes
Each task can be viewed independently through the navigation bar.
This project was built with care, clarity, and developer experience in mind — I hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as I enjoyed building it!


Thanks again for your time and consideration.
